TODO:

add ship computer component, lower effeciency lowers the chances of it sucsessfully doing things like auto-jettison, or the accuracy of portal warps  and if it goes out it is unable to slow your turning speed, along with loosing access to most stats your systems have ( like temperature, or damage.)

if something is about to fail in a way that will result in the players death ( eg: the gas tank exploding or a meltdown ) make it so you need to do a minigame if the computer isnt active
