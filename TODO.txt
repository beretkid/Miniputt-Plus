TODO:
also a roadmap i guess if you want to see it like that, though this was written specificly for me.
add ship computer component, lower effeciency lowers the chances of it sucsessfully doing things like auto-jettison, or the accuracy of portal warps  and if it goes out it is unable to slow your turning speed, along with loosing access to most stats your systems have ( like temperature, or damage.) -- half done

if something is about to fail in a way that will result in the players death ( eg: the gas tank exploding or a meltdown ) make it so you need to do a minigame if the computer isnt active

add stations
add guns
they sent an email

add system that uses pending alerts for the message system
like: ["im dying","im dying but now purple for some reason; idk man im just dying, ok??"] -- done.

pending notifictations
then remove the first one and broadcast it


also add collision for all

optimisation time!!!!!!

check difference from its current turn when turning twoards it

make it so you need to purchase the systems panel as an upgrade


add grain to the console when the ship computer is damaged

add @r for repairs

get a broad repair upgrade to add an option to repair the three most damaged systems
