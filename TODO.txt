TODO:
also a roadmap i guess if you want to see it like that, though this was written specificly for me.
add ship computer component, lower effeciency lowers the chances of it sucsessfully doing things like auto-jettison, or the accuracy of portal warps  and if it goes out it is unable to slow your turning speed, along with loosing access to most stats your systems have ( like temperature, or damage.) -- half done

if something is about to fail in a way that will result in the players death ( eg: the gas tank exploding or a meltdown ) make it so you need to do a minigame if the computer isnt active

add stations
add guns
they sent an email

add system that uses pending alerts for the message system
like: ["im dying","im dying but now purple for some reason; idk man im just dying, ok??"]

pending notifictations
then remove the first one and broadcast it


also add collision for all
